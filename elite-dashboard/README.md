### Dashboard Visuals
1. **Top Page KPIs**
	- Replaced previous KPIs with:
	  - **Total Projects** (e.g., 152, +12% vs last month) with breakdown by status: On Track / Delayed / Completed. White background used for this KPI.
	  - **Total Estimated Construction Value** (e.g., $250M, +5% Growth).
	  - **Average Project Size** (mÂ²).
	- Statistic Cards inspired by [reui.io/blocks](https://reui.io/blocks) "Statistic Cards".
2. **Projects Added Per Month**
	- Replaces "Average Price by Month" visual.
3. **Market Size by Location (in $)**
	- Replaces "Properties by Status" visual.
4. **Map Visual**
	- Added map visualization with bubbles for location-based data.
5. **Removed Visuals**
	- Removed "Average Size by Month" and "City Performance" visuals.
6. **Recent Activity & Property Type Distribution**
	- Kept these visuals. Property type distribution visual updated for consistent colors and format. Apartment % bug fixed.
7. **Table Visual**
	- Added an Edit button to display all data columns. (Edit functionality is UI only, not functional yet.)
